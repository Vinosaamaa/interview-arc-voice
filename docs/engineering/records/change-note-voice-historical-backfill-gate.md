# Voice Validates Bounded Historical Engineering Batches

Voice already required one numbered forward receipt. Historical publication still needed a bounded, add-only gate so reconstructed receipts could land without rewriting accepted history or inferring missing evidence.

## Change

The Voice pull-request workflow now vendors the shared historical-batch contract and validates a publication pull request against it. A historical PR keeps one forward `reconstructed: false` receipt classified `None`, adds at most twenty reconstructed receipts, and may add at most eight reconstructed rich records. The numbered manifest must enumerate those documents exactly, stay add-only against the pull-request base, and cite an owning-repository comment whose entire body is the residual-link authorization sentence.

Hosted validation reads that comment through GitHub and requires repository-owner authorship. The gate does not authorize history rewrites, evidence deletion, visibility changes, or later batches. Product runtime behavior is unchanged.
